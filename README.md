### How to run

In the JARs directory, there is a jar file named pbj2.jar.
To run this and many other jars, execute the following
command in a command prompt window:

```
java -jar /path/to/pbj2.jar
```

NOTE: it is important to have your Java Runtime Environment
updated to the current release before executing this command.

### How to Interact with the App

Once run, Cooking Companion will show display a graphical
interface to the user. There are 3 buttons on the bottom:
Import Ingredients, Help, and Settings. The "Import Ingredients"
button allows the user to select a text file from their
computer and import it into the app. This text file should
be the user's "pantry", meaning the file will contain
items/ingredients the user currently has at their disposal.
Clicking the "Help" button shows information found later in
this README in case the user needs assistance operating the app.
Finally, the "Settings" button opens a window that contains
fields to update the database connection parameters, as well
as an option to switch between light or dark mode.

For basic searches, simply enter a keyword or name of a recipe
you would like to make! Scroll through the recipes, and if
you see one you like, click on it to find out more details.

If you want to find recipes that accommodate food allergies like
dairy or tree nuts, mark the checkbox below the search bar to
enable the respective filter.

To find recipes that you can make with your current ingredients,
you must do the following:

- Create a .txt file
- In said file, write out ingredients you own, one ingredient per line
- Once you have this file on your device, press the import ingredients button and select your file
- Once the file is uploaded, a default search will occur that finds recipes using your list
- If you would like to then search for specific recipes based on your list, type your search and check the "Owned Ingredients Only" checkbox
